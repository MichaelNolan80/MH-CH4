# Building a Hacking VertualLab
## Downloading and Install the Software - 

- 1 - I started by download the lastest VMware Software <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro">From here. You need to be signed in.</a> Make sure you pick the right operating system you are putting the VMware on. 
- 2 - I downloaded Kali Linux <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images">From here.</a>
- 3 - I installed the VMware onto an extra partition on my hard drive.
- 4 - I now look at what system resorces my laptop have so I knew how much I have to give.
- 5 - I have 32gbs of RAM and my processer is - 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1265U   1.80 GHz. This means I have 10 cores and 12 threads
- 6 - Installed Kali making sure I give it enough disk space,(40 GB) im going to keep it on a single file as this part of the hard drive is just for the VM ware. Ill add 2 cores with 2 proccerers each. Ill add 4GBs of RAM and see how I get on.
- 7 - Once Kali has loaded its time to update the operating system.
